>  Dead simple command line utility to clone balenaCloud applications

More like, a balena.yml creator from existing applications. 

## Install & just straight up clone!

```
npx balenaclone
```

## Minimal Instructions! 

Only balena Team Members can use these instructions till we release this to the world.
Head to dashboard.balena-cloud.com and click the `Create Application` button. Toggle the `Advanced` button on there to upload the `balena.yml` file you just generated and voila we cloned your app! We are working on using full on DWB for that and make this entire procedure one click but thought to give more freedom to people if they want to edit files up their own way. 

Also, a great a utility for folks wanting to create [Deploy with balena](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/deploy/deploy-with-balena-button/) buttons and get their apps uploaded on [balenaHub](https://www.hub.balena.io).
